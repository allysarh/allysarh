# Hello!
### 👋 Hi, my name is Allysa!
My education background is chemical engineering but I really enjoy software development so I could claim my self as junior/ entry level software developer. 😀
<br>
- 👀 I’m interested in web app development using react.js and node.js
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be more fluent by creating some projects also cloning some web app (and mobile app using react native) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more projects that using SCRUM in order to get more familiar to work in a team! 
<br>
I made some projects and existed in this repository, feel free too look about it!
<br>
There are still a lot that I have not learned yet, and I'm happy to learn more and more 👩🏼‍🏫
<br>

### Anyway, thank you for coming!
If you have any question about me or my project, kindly let me know!

- 📫 The best way to reach me is via email: allysa.rahagustiani@gmail.com
